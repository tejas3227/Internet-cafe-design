# Internet-cafe-design
I have designed Internet cafe design in cisco packet tracer. I have implemented the protocols in the computer netwoks like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Also i have added the report that we prepared for the reference.
